A message on the flutter/lifecycle channel was discarded before it could be handled.
This happens when a plugin sends messages to the framework side before the framework has had an opportunity to register a listener. See the ChannelBuffers API
documentation for details on how to configure the channel to expect more messages, or to expect messages to get discarded:
